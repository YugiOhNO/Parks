                <p>Mullaly Park is named after a civic official from Belfast, Ireland, named John Mullaly. He was born in 1835.
                From the New York Herald, to the New York Tribune and even the New York Evening Post, Mullay was a major component in the success of on-site reporting.
                He even broke the story on the initiation of the Transatlantic Cable back in 1857. Around 1881, he founded the New York Parks Association, and tirelessly campaigned for the development of atleast 4000 acres of parkland in the southern Bronx.</br>
                Because of his extraordinary efforts, John Mullaly is now regarded as the "Father of the Bronx Park system".
                Mullaly Park has numerous amenities such as baseball fields, basketball courts, a Summer swimming pool and even holds the record for the first New York City Parks Department skatepark.</p>

                <img src="img/hig6.jpg" alt="../img/hig2.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
                <p>Although located in Manhattan, Highbridge Park, is partially located in the Bronx.
                This is due to the Highbridge, which is the oldest standing bridge in the entire city.
                Originally designed as an aqueduct to carry water from the Croton River into the city.</br>
                But due to complications with delivery speed, and inadequate maintainence, the bridge was due to be demolished. After tremendous local effort, the bridge was repaired and remodeled into the gorgeous park we have today.
                The historical park not only features tremendous views of both Manhattan and the Bronx, but also offers one of the biggest skateparks in the city.
                In addition to this, it has a generous sized Summer swimming pool, and a unique mountain bike trail.</p>

                <img src="img/mac3.jpg" alt="img/mac2.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
                <p>Macomb's Dam Park opened around 1899, in order to provide livable and sustainable greenspaces for the congressional district to inhabit and use.
                Prior to the construction of the Yankee Stadium (2009), the park featured a large football field, a soccer field, a track, and 3 baseball fields.
                The downside was that the park was poorly maintained, and often used as spillaway parking for Yankee Stadium (1923) attendants.</br>
                After major debate between the locals, Bronx officials, and the Yankees organization, the Yankee Stadium (2009) was built.
                Because of this, the new Macomb's Dam Park was to replace the old Yankee stadium and feature more space and amenities.
                As of now, the park features multiple basketball courts and baseball fields, a handful of handball courts, and large areas for both football and soccer.</p>

                <img src="img/joy3.jpg" alt="img/joy2.jpg" height="100%" width="100%">
                <p>Joyce Kilmer Park, opened in 1902 as the Concourse Plaza, named after its location between 162nd and 164th street.
                It was named Joyce Kilmer, after the man himself, who was a journalist and a soldier.
                After he died in World War I, the City Council Board decided to rename the park in the man's honor.
                Kilmer is noted most by his poem 'Trees', which starts:</br></p>
                <p class="ital">"I think that I shall never see / a poem lovely as a tree."</p>
                <p>In similar fashion, Joyce Kilmer Park is a beautiful park to see, with its famous Lorelei Fountain and relaxing scenery.</p>
